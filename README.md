# Lung Cancer Detection

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Screening high risk individuals for lung cancer with low-dose CT scans is now being implemented in the United States and other countries are expected to follow soon. In CT lung cancer screening, many millions of CT scans will have to be analyzed, which is an enormous burden for radiologists. Therefore there is a lot of interest to develop computer algorithms to optimize screening.
A vital first step in the analysis of lung cancer screening CT scans is the detection of pulmonary nodules, which may or may not represent early stage lung cancer.

This project is about segmentation of nodules in CT scans using 2D U-Net Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
